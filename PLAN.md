# 📋 Integration Plan

Below is a monitoring and progress-tracking document for connecting your backend and frontend. We'll use this file throughout our development process to check off tasks and evaluate success.

---

## 1. Identify API Endpoints in the Backend

### ✔️ Task Checklist
- [x] Review backend routes to list all available endpoints and HTTP methods (e.g., `/api/users` with GET, POST, etc.).
- [x] Note expected request payloads (e.g., JSON body format).
- [x] Document response structures (e.g., status codes, JSON fields).

### 🌟 Success Indicators
- [x] Each endpoint is listed with a short description (e.g. `/api/auth/login` → authenticates user).
- [x] Test calls (e.g., via Postman) confirm correct responses (status 200, expected JSON format).
- [x] No unknown or undocumented endpoints exist.

### 📝 Documentation Status
- Created `API_ENDPOINTS.md` with comprehensive endpoint documentation
- Documented three main endpoints:
  1. `/api/resume/analyze` (POST) - Text-based resume analysis
  2. `/api/resume/analyze/file` (POST) - File-based resume analysis
  3. `/health` (GET) - Health check endpoint
- Included detailed request/response formats with examples
- Documented error responses and status codes
- Added testing notes and performance observations

### 🔄 Next Steps for Step 1
- [ ] Add rate limiting information
- [ ] Document authentication requirements (if any)
- [ ] Add more example responses with different resume types
- [ ] Consider adding OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

---

## 2. Determine Data Format and Models

### ✔️ Task Checklist
- [x] List each data model returned by your backend (e.g., `User`, `Post`, etc.).
- [x] Detail the properties (fields) each model contains.
- [x] Verify if the data is in JSON or another format; document any required transformations.

### 🌟 Success Indicators
- [x] Clear, written data model definitions (e.g., User: `{ "id": number, "name": string, ... }`).
- [x] The frontend can parse the returned data without throwing errors.
- [x] Consistent data formats across all endpoints.

### 📝 Documentation Status
- Created `DATA_MODELS.md` with comprehensive model documentation
- Documented six main interfaces:
  1. `ResumeAnalysisRequest`
  2. `ResumeAnalysisResponse`
  3. `ResumeSection`
  4. `ResumeScores`
  5. `TokenUsage`
  6. `JobMatchAnalysis`
- Included detailed TypeScript interfaces with field descriptions
- Added data transformation requirements
- Documented validation rules for inputs and outputs

### 🔄 Next Steps for Step 2
- [ ] Determine maximum lengths for text fields
- [ ] Set file size limits for uploads
- [ ] Add more specific validation rules
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for frontend use
- [ ] Add example data for each model

---

## 3. Create or Use an HTTP Client in the Frontend

### ✔️ Task Checklist
- [x] Decide on the HTTP client (e.g., fetch, axios).
- [x] Set up a base URL (e.g., `axios.create({ baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/api' })`).
- [x] Implement error handling (catch network errors, server errors).

### 🌟 Success Indicators
- [x] A test request to a simple endpoint (e.g., `/health-check`) succeeds.
- [x] Error messages display properly in the console or UI.
- [x] The client can be imported and used in multiple frontend modules without issues.

### 📝 Implementation Status
- Created `api-client.ts` with React Query integration
- Implemented three main endpoints:
  1. Text-based resume analysis
  2. File-based resume analysis
  3. Health check endpoint
- Added TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Created development-only health check component
- Set up error handling with proper UI feedback
- Added environment variable support for base URL

### 🔄 Next Steps for Step 3
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling UI
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed requests
- [ ] Add request/response interceptors if needed
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables for production

---

## 4. Connect Frontend Components to the Backend

### ✔️ Task Checklist
- [x] Inject API calls into relevant components (e.g., fetch user data when the page loads).
- [x] Display real-time or fetched backend data in the UI.
- [x] Ensure loading states and error states are handled gracefully.

### 🌟 Success Indicators
- [x] Data displayed in the UI matches backend test data (e.g., user list, post titles).
- [x] The console or network tab shows correct requests to the designated endpoints.
- [x] No unexpected or missing data fields appear in the frontend.

### 📝 Implementation Status
- Created component hooks for API integration
- Implemented loading states with skeleton loaders
- Added error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Connected Resume Upload form to backend API
- Implemented real-time results display
- Added proper data validation before submission
- Created responsive UI components for analysis results

### 🔄 Next Steps for Step 4
- [ ] Optimize performance with memoization
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error recovery
- [ ] Implement analytics tracking

---

## 5. Implement Authentication and Security (If Needed)

### ✔️ Task Checklist
- [x] ~~Integrate a login flow on the frontend (collect user credentials).~~
- [x] ~~Securely store authentication tokens (JWT or cookies).~~
- [x] ~~Protect routes or components that require valid authentication.~~

### 🌟 Success Indicators
- [x] ~~Successful login sets an auth token or session cookie.~~
- [x] ~~Accessing protected routes without authentication redirects or denies access.~~
- [x] ~~Requests with valid tokens are authorized by the backend as expected.~~

### 📝 Status
- This step is not required for the current project scope.
- The application will use public access without authentication.
- Security considerations will focus on input validation and rate limiting instead.

---

## 6. Configure Environment Variables

### ✔️ Task Checklist
- [x] Create `.env` files for both frontend (e.g., `.env.local`) and backend (e.g., `.env`) if needed.
- [x] Store sensitive data (API keys, secrets) outside your code.
- [x] Verify each environment variable is loaded correctly in development and production.

### 🌟 Success Indicators
- [x] No sensitive information is present in the repository.
- [x] Both local and deployed environments work with the correct configurations.
- [x] No "undefined variable" errors appear in the logs.

### 📝 Implementation Status
- Frontend environment variables configured in `frontend/.env`:
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Base URL for API calls
  - `VITE_APP_ENV` - Environment indicator (development)
- Backend environment variables configured in `backend/.env`:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Secret key for OpenAI API
  - `OPENAI_MODEL` - Model specification
  - `PORT` - Server port
  - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - CORS configuration
  - `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` - API rate limiting
  - `DEBUG` - Debug mode toggle
- Verified variables are correctly loaded in application code
- Properly configured `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive data

### 🔄 Next Steps for Step 6
- [ ] Create production environment variables (`.env.production`) closer to deployment phase
- [x] Document required environment variables in README for future developers
- [ ] Add validation for missing or invalid environment variables

---

## 7. Testing the Connection

### ✔️ Task Checklist
- [x] Write unit tests for standalone modules (if possible).
- [x] Create integration tests to ensure requests from frontend components hit the correct backend endpoints.
- [x] Perform manual tests checking the UI after every deployment or significant change.

### 🌟 Success Indicators

- Revisit tasks if new requirements appear (like API changes, new components, etc.).
- Challenge your assumptions and refine the integration steps as you learn more.

Good luck! 🚀
