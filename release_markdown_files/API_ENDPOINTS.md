- The analysis endpoints typically respond within 2-3 seconds
- The health check endpoint responds almost instantly
- File upload supports PDF and DOCX formats
- Job description matching is optional but provides additional insights

## Next Steps
- [x] Add example requests and responses for each endpoint
- [x] Document error responses
- [ ] Add rate limiting information
- [ ] Document authentication requirements (if any)
- [ ] Add more example responses with different resume types

## üîÑ Updates
- Initial documentation created based on testing experience
- Updated to match actual backend implementation
- Added file upload endpoint documentation
- Added detailed error response documentation
