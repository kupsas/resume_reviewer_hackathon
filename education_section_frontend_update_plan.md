# Education Section Frontend Update Plan üéì

## Overview

The backend API has been updated to provide more structured information about education entries. This document outlines the steps needed to update the frontend to display and handle the new education section data format.

## Current vs New Education Data Format

### Current Format
```typescript
export interface ResumePoint {
  text: string;
  star: {
    situation: boolean;
    task: boolean;
    action: boolean;
    result: boolean;
    complete: boolean;
  };
  metrics: string[];
  technical_score: number;
  improvement: string;
}
```

### New Format (for Education sections)
```typescript
export interface EducationPoint {
  text: string;
  subject: string;
  course: string;
  school: string;
  subject_course_school_reputation: {
    domestic_score: number;
    domestic_score_rationale: string;
    international_score: number;
    international_score_rationale: string;
  };
}
```

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Update Type Definitions ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úÖ
- Completed: Added new interfaces for education points in `frontend/src/types/resume.ts`
- Completed: Created discriminated union type for ResumePoint in `frontend/src/types/resume.ts`
- Completed: Updated ResumeSection to handle both types in `frontend/src/types/resume.ts`
- Status: ‚úÖ DONE

### 2. Create Education-Specific Component üß© ‚úÖ
- Completed: Created EducationCard component with modern UI in `frontend/src/components/EducationCard.tsx`
- Completed: Implemented reputation score display with progress bars in `frontend/src/components/EducationCard.tsx`
- Completed: Added tooltips for score rationales in `frontend/src/components/EducationCard.tsx`
- Completed: Included improvement suggestions section in `frontend/src/components/EducationCard.tsx`
- Status: ‚úÖ DONE

### 3. Create Type Guard Function üõ°Ô∏è ‚úÖ
- Completed: Added isEducationPoint type guard function in `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts`
- Completed: Added proper TypeScript type safety and documentation
- Status: ‚úÖ DONE

### 4. Update Section Analysis Component üîÑ ‚úÖ
- Completed: Updated `frontend/src/components/SectionAnalysis.tsx` to handle both education and standard resume points
- Completed: Added type checking for education points using the type guard from `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts`
- Completed: Implemented conditional rendering of `EducationCard` vs `StarAnalysisCard` components
- Status: ‚úÖ DONE

### 5. Update Resume Analysis Component üìä ‚úÖ
- Completed: Updated `frontend/src/components/ResumeAnalysis.tsx` to use the new SectionAnalysis component
- Completed: Removed direct point mapping in favor of SectionAnalysis component
- Completed: Updated imports and component structure
- Status: ‚úÖ DONE

### 6. Update Sample Data for Testing üß™ ‚úÖ
- Completed: Added comprehensive education section to `frontend/src/mocks/data/resumeData.ts`
- Completed: Included three different types of education entries (undergraduate, graduate, certification)
- Completed: Added realistic reputation scores and rationales
- Status: ‚úÖ DONE

## Testing Plan

1. Unit Tests
   - Create tests for the new EducationCard component
   - Update tests for SectionAnalysis to include education section handling
   - Test the type guard function with various inputs

2. Integration Tests
   - Test the full flow with mock API responses
   - Verify correct display of education section data

## Notes

- The Education section has a visually distinct appearance from Experience/Projects sections
- Education sections no longer use STAR format, metrics, or technical scores
- Visual indicators for reputation scores use progress bars for a more intuitive display
- Tooltips provide additional context about the reputation scores

## Next Steps

1. Implement the changes in the development environment
2. Conduct code review with the team
3. Write unit and integration tests
4. Test with real API responses
5. Deploy to staging environment for QA testing
