# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
The AI-powered Resume Reviewer Website will guide users in creating more effective resumes by analyzing and comparing their resume content against best practices and specific job requirements. Users can optionally provide a job description to receive targeted, section-wise feedback. The product will support job seekers across all industries, leveraging AI capabilities for robust analysis and actionable feedback.

## 2. Goals & Objectives
1. **Help users craft better resumes** by providing clear and constructive feedback.  
2. **Streamline the resume review process** with automated suggestions tailored to individual backgrounds and desired roles.  
3. **Offer easy-to-understand scoring** so users can gauge their resume's effectiveness.  
4. **Provide an integrated experience** including LinkedIn profile analysis, job description matching, and ATS compatibility checks.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Job Description Alignment
- **Optional Input**: Users can provide a job description along with their resume.  
- **Alignment Analysis**: The platform highlights sections of the resume that align or diverge from the job requirements.  
- **Actionable Suggestions**: If discrepancies are found, the AI offers targeted improvements (e.g., suggested keywords, rephrased accomplishments).

### 3.2 Resume Formatting Guidance
- **Format Recommendation**: Suggest the most suitable format (chronological, functional, or combination) based on the user's work history, skill set, and target industry.  
- **Section-by-Section Breakdown**: Outline best practices for each resume section (e.g., Summary, Experience, Education, Skills).

### 3.3 Automated Bullet Points
- **AI-Generated Suggestions**: For users with incomplete or generic resume lines, the system can generate improved bullet points reflecting both their experience and the target job's needs.  
- **Customization & Editing**: Users can refine or edit these bullet points before finalizing their resumes.

### 3.4 Security and Data Privacy
- **No Data Storage**: The application operates in a stateless manner, processing resumes in real-time without storing any user data.
- **Secure Processing**: All resume analysis is performed in-memory and data is discarded after the session.
- **Transparency**: Clear communication to users about the no-storage policy.

### 3.5 Resume Strength Score
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Assign a score based on factors such as keyword relevance, clarity, structure, and format adherence.  
- **Progress Tracking**: Show improvements or changes in the score after users implement suggestions.

### 3.6 Extended Integrations
- **LinkedIn Profile Analysis**: Pull relevant data or skills from a user's LinkedIn profile to enhance resume content.  
- **Job Description Matching**: Compare the user's resume directly to common keywords and requirements in job listings.  
- **ATS Compatibility Checks**: Evaluate whether the resume meets formatting and content standards typically required by Applicant Tracking Systems.

## 4. User Journey

1. **Upload/Creation**: User uploads an existing resume.
2. **Optional Job Description**: User inputs a job description (optional)
3. **Analysis**: System performs alignment checks, format recommendations, bullet point generation, and scoring.  
4. **Feedback & Suggestions**:  
   - **Section-Wise Review**: Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, etc.  
   - **Alignment Insights**: Specific highlights showing how well each section matches the job requirements.  
   - **Improvement Opportunities**: Tailored bullet points, rephrasing suggestions, and formatting enhancements.  
5. **Score Report**: Display an overall resume strength score with a breakdown of contributing factors.  
6. **Iteration**: User may revise sections and re-check their resume for an updated score.  

## 5. Functional Requirements
