# 📋 Step 3 Progress: HTTP Client Setup

## 🎯 Original Requirements
From the integration plan, we needed to:
1. Decide on the HTTP client
2. Set up a base URL
3. Implement error handling

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. HTTP Client Selection
- Chose `@tanstack/react-query` as our HTTP client
  - Provides powerful caching and state management
  - Built-in error handling
  - Automatic retries and background updates
  - TypeScript support

### 2. Base URL Configuration
- Implemented in `api-client.ts`:
  ```typescript
  const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
  ```
- Uses environment variables for flexibility
- Falls back to localhost for development

### 3. Error Handling
- Created `handleApiError` helper function:
  ```typescript
  const handleApiError = async (response: Response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      const error = await response.json();
      throw new Error(error.detail || 'An error occurred');
    }
    return response.json();
  };
  ```
- Implemented error handling in React Query mutations
- Added error logging in development mode

### 4. Additional Implementations
- Created TypeScript interfaces for all API types
- Implemented three main endpoints:
  1. Text-based resume analysis
  2. File-based resume analysis
  3. Health check endpoint
- Added development-only health check component
- Set up React Query provider in main app

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Success Indicators
1. ✅ Test request to health endpoint
   - Implemented and tested
   - Shows loading state
   - Displays success/error messages
   - Only visible in development mode

2. ✅ Error message display
   - Implemented in console
   - Added UI error states
   - Development-only error display

3. ✅ Client import/usage
   - Successfully imported in multiple components
   - Modular design allows easy reuse
   - Type-safe implementation

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Add more comprehensive error handling UI
2. Implement retry logic for failed requests
3. Add request/response interceptors if needed
4. Set up proper environment variables for production

## 📝 Notes
- Health check component is development-only
- Using Vite's environment variables for mode detection
- All API types are fully typed with TypeScript
- React Query provides automatic caching and state management

## 🚀 Production Considerations
- Health check component is automatically removed in production
- Environment variables need to be set in production
- Error handling is simplified in production
- API base URL needs to be configured for production environment
