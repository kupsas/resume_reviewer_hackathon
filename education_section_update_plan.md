# Education Section Update Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a step-by-step plan to update the education section format in our resume analysis API to include additional fields: subject, course, school, and reputation scores.

## Current Structure
```json
"type": "Education",
"points": [
  {
    "text": "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science University of California, Berkeley | 2015-2019",
    "star": { ... },
    "metrics": [],
    "technical_score": 0,
    "improvement": "..."
  }
]
```

## Target Structure
```json
"type": "Education",
"text": "{{all the text in the education section}}",
"subject": "Electrical and Electronics Engineering",
"course": "Bachelor of Engineering",
"school": "BITS Pilani",
"subject_course_school_reputation": {
  "domestic_score": 9,
  "domestic_score_rationale": "BITS Pilani is one of the most prestigious engineering institutions in India...",
  "international_score": 6,
  "international_score_rationale": "BITS Pilani has a growing international presence..."
}
```

## Technical Details

### Key Files to Modify
1. `backend/app/services/openai_service.py`
2. `backend/app/services/resume_analyzer.py`
3. `backend/app/services/resume_formats.py`
4. `backend/app/services/resume_analyzer/utils/validation.py`
5. `backend/app/models/resume_analysis.py`
6. `backend/tests/integration/test_resume_api.py`
7. `backend/tests/e2e/test_resume_analyzer_e2e.py`

### Implementation Notes
- Remove STAR format, metrics, technical scores for education sections
- Ensure prompt is specific about expected reputation score format (0-10 scale)
- Add validation to ensure required fields are present
- Consider caching mechanism for expensive API calls during testing

## Progress Details

### Step 1: Analysis & Planning ‚úÖ
1. Reviewed and analyzed existing schema and processing logic
2. Created comprehensive test data with 9 diverse samples including:
   - Top-tier institutions (Harvard, Johns Hopkins)
   - International universities (University of Toronto)
   - Regional institutions (Local State University)
   - Technical institutes (IIT Bombay)
   - Community colleges
   - Various degree types (MD, MBA, M.Tech, etc.)
3. Identified all dependent validation schemas and their relationships

### Step 2: Prompt Development ‚úÖ
1. Created test script `test_education_prompt.py` for prompt development
2. Developed and tested three prompt variations:
   - Long prompt (detailed analysis)
   - Medium prompt (balanced detail)
   - Short prompt (concise analysis)
3. Selected the long prompt for its comprehensive analysis and detailed rationales
4. Achieved consistent extraction of required fields:
   - Subject
   - Course
   - School
   - Reputation scores (domestic and international)
   - Detailed rationales for each score
5. Validation schema successfully implemented with:
   - `EducationReputation` model for reputation scores
   - `EducationAnalysis` model for education-specific fields
   - Updated `SectionAnalysis` model with education support

### Next Steps
1. Begin comprehensive testing suite
2. Create unit tests for new validation
3. Test integration with full analysis flow
4. Plan deployment strategy

## Prompt Development
For efficient prompt development without full API costs:
```python
# sample_education_prompt_tester.py
import asyncio
import json
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

async def test_education_prompt(education_text, prompt):
    client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key="your-key")
    response = await client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": education_text}
        ],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"},
        temperature=0
    )
    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)

# Example usage in command line
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("sample_education.txt") as f:
        sample = f.read()
    with open("education_prompt_v1.txt") as f:
        prompt = f.read()
    
    result = asyncio.run(test_education_prompt(sample, prompt))
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

This plan prioritizes efficient development and testing while ensuring the changes are robust and maintainable.
